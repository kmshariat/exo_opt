# Parameter Optimization of Transit Exoplanet Data

Planets outside of our solar system that orbit stars other than our Sun are known as extrasolar planets or exoplanets. The first exoplanet orbiting a sun like star was discovered using the `transit method` in 1995. A transit occurs when an exoplanet passes across the face of its host star and blocks out some of the star's light. Upon studying the light curve of the star, a plot of brightness (flux) vs time, a dip in the brightness of the star can be observed.
